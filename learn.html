<p>The Learning Center will help walk you through the day-to-day experience of using and understanding KISSmetrics. In a nutshell, these are the five major steps your team will be repeating as you use KISSmetrics (or any other analytics platform for that matter).</p>

<h2>The Analytics Cycle</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Decide on which reports you currently need.</li>
  <li>Assess what new pieces of data you will need to send to KISSmetrics, in the form of events and properties.</li>
  <li>Choose the method(s) you will be sending data, based on the developer resources available.</li>
  <li>Implement the event/property tracking and test.</li>
  <li>Create and run the reports you planned for.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Content Coming Soon!</h2>
