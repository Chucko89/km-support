## When should I expect to see data?

Once you have created a custom event, you will be able to see these events **right away** using our [Live][live] feature.

Within **2-6 hours** from the moment an event is triggered, this data will be available in the rest of our reports - our funnels, cohort reports, people search, revenue report, and metrics. This is the estimated time spent in processing the customer records across all of our servers. If you donâ€™t see any data beyond the time periods listed above, contact support so we can verify all is working properly.

[live]: /tools/live
