KISSmetrics is currently testing a [People Search][people-search]-based Data Out API with select customers.

Once you have created a People Search report from the KISSmetrics interface, you will be able to write scripts to connect to a report's API endpoint. KISSmetrics will return the people search results in a parseable format. The API can automatically choose a date range or accept a date range as an argument.

## Example Use Case

Let's say you are a SaaS customer with a people search to list everyone who `Signed Up` yesterday, along with their names and billing plans. You would be able to query our API every day to obtain a list of these people.

## More Details to Come

This is our initial offering. We will continue to update the page with API specifications as functionality is added.

Do you have an example of how you would use our Data Out API? [Share with us][feedback]!
