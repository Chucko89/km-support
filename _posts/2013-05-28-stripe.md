summary: Import your existing Stripe transaction data into KISSmetrics.

---
If you have been using [Stripe][stripe] to track [**subscriptions**][subscriptions], you can now import event data about the people who purchased or refunded.

## Integration Details

Event Name | Properties | Identity
-----------| ---------- | --------
`Subscription Billed` | `Subscription Billing Amount`: (positive transaction amount) | Email address, according to Stripe
        | `Subscription Billing Length`: (number of months until the next billing period) | 
        | `Subscription Plan Level`: (plan type of the customer) | 

*Our [SaaS Revenue Report][saas-rr] encourages you to track upgrade and downgrade events. However, our Stripe integration* ***does not automatically record the following events***, *and you should track them manually if you plan to make the most of our SaaS Revenue Report:*

* `Subscription Upgraded`
* `Subscription Downgraded`
* `Subscription Canceled`, {`Subscription Cancelation Reason`}

#### Frequency of Import

* We will only import successful transactions.
* Test transactions are omitted.
* We will check every hour for new transactions.
