KISSmetrics is currently testing our Core API that allows you to
retrieve and work with core aspects of our system. It allows you to
query information about your **Accounts**, **Products**, **Reports**, **Events**, and
**Properties**.

## Introduction

### Generate an API token

In order to work with our API you need to generate **Personal Token** from within your KISSmetrics administration interface. This can be viewed from within the _Account settings_ menu option. You will see _Manage API Tokens_. From there you can **Generate a new token** and you are ready to get started.

### Request Requirements

#### Content Negotiation 

We currently only support **JSON** (`application/json`) in our request lifecycle. You can specify this with an HTTP Header:

```curl
Accept: application/json
```

When we require a `POST` to an endpoint, such as our People Search execution, you must specify the `Content-Type`.

```curl
Content-Type: application/json
```

#### Authentication

We require **authentication** via the `Authorization` HTTP header. All requests must be made over `HTTPS`. Calls made over `HTTP` will result in an error. Authentication is required for all requests.

```curl
Authorization: Bearer your-token-here
```

#### Pagination

All lists of objects support pagination. Those requests will include a common pagination structure. The default `limit` is set to **20**. 

```json
{
	"pagination": {
		"total": 6,
		"offset": 0,
		"limit": 20
	}
}

```

##### Available Arguments

* `limit` (optional) Use this to set the number of items to be returned.
* `offset` (optional) Use this to specify the offset from within the collection of items.

Along with standard `pagination` information, there are also `link` elements with pre-built `URI`s for `next`, `previous`, `last`, and `first`. This allows you to reference the links in a scripted environment and for _auto pagination_. 

```json
[
	{
		"templated": false,
		"href": "https://api.kissmetrics.com/core/products?limit=1&offset=0",
	    "rel": "first",
	    "name": "First"
	  },
	  {
	    "templated": false,
	    "href": "https://api.kissmetrics.com/core/products?limit=1&offset=5",
	    "rel": "last",
	    "name": "Last"
	  },
	  {
	    "templated": false,
	    "href": "https://api.kissmetrics.com/core/products?limit=1&offset=2",
	    "rel": "next",
	    "name": "Next"
	  },
	  {
	    "templated": false,
	    "href": "https://api.kissmetrics.com/core/products?limit=1&offset=0",
    	"rel": "prev",
    	"name": "Previous"
  	}
]
```

## API Reference

All requests in the examples assume proper `Authorization` and `Accept` headers. All examples utilize `curl`, but could be executed with any HTTP client of your choosing.

### Root Directory

The root directory returns a list of all available `link`s within the API.
