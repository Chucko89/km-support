Try sending data to KISSmetrics through one of our integrations or other API libraries.

# Exercise

* If you have the relevant data, try importing a small sample of events and properties by uploading a CSV file, using email addresses as the person's `identity`.
* Investigate which [integrations][integrations] you may be able to use.

# Takeaways

* You can import data from the past, if you have that past data available per person.
* CSV files are a viable option for people of any technical level. The only difficulty is in converting the dates to timestamps that are computer-readable. Our preferred tool for doing this is [Epoch Converter][epoch-convert].
* We merge data together from several data sources, EXCEPT FOR ONE CAVEAT WE'LL TALK ABOUT NEXT

[integrations]: /integrations
