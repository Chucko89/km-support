First event with Event Wizard


# Exercise

Practice creating URL-based events

# Takeaways

* Works well when you want to make changes and are less technical, or don't want to get caught up making a lot of frequent code changes.
* Works when the JS snippet is on the pages you want to track.
* However, it's less flexible than invoking the API (you can't use regexes for URL patterns) - in the sense that you will be hard-coding the names of events.
* It takes some time for the rules to take effect.
