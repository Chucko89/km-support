It's hard to encapsulate *everything* that KISSmetrics customers can do. It's more effective to show than to tell. Here is the **[KISSmetrics Demo][demo]**, which shows reports that an example business might run regularly. As you'll notice, the types of reports are tailored to whether the business is Subscription-based, E-commerce, or a Mobile App.

For people new to the world of analytics, pay attention to what is being studied here. We excel at helping reveal **Customer Lifecycle**. What differentiates your loyal customers from the customers on-the-fence?

For people who purchased KISSmetrics to achieve some set objectives, it's still helpful to look through the demo to get familiar with the reports and where everything is laid out.

Our successful customers use KISSmetrics to analyze:

* Revenue
* A/B test experiments
* Ad campaigns or other URL-tagged marketing channels
