There are three main types of KISSmetrics data: Events, Properties, and People. Let's get acquainted with the first one: the Event.

Events designate actions.



# Exercise

Determine which event(s) you need for the metric you picked in the last exercise, and when it should occur.

# Takeaways

1. Events represent actions that your customers do.
2. Events can represent major actions in the customer's lifetime (Signed Up), or more minor ones (Opened an Email). Google Analytics refers to these as macro-conversions and micro-conversions.
3. Events are an easy way to group together similar people.
4. If {X} happened then trigger an event.

Common ways we'll express this:

"Fire an event" or "An event was fired"
"Trigger an event" or "An event is triggered"

"The event occurred" or "The event happened"
