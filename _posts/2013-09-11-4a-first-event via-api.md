First Event via JS API

# Exercise

Practice using `_kmq.push(['record', 'Event Name']);`

# Takeaways

* Record events when the JS `_kmq.push(['record', 'Event Name']);` is executed.
* You can set up logic to only execute this API call when the event actually happens, not just upon page load.
* Within the JS library, there are specialized functions to help record events upon actions like:
  * Clicking an element
  * Submitting a form
  * Clicking a link that leads off of your domain

You can learn about these later.
