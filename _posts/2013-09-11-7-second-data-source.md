Import a CSV file

* "You can import past data"
* "You can send data not only through JavaScript, even though JS will capture a lot of useful information"

# Exercise

* Import your first small sample of a CSV file, using email addresses as the person's 'identity'. This will be explained in the next section.

# Takeaways

* You can import data from the past, if you have it stored on a per-person level.
* CSV files are a viable option for people of any technical level. The only difficulty is in converting the dates to timestamps that are computer-readable. (Epoch)
* We merge data together from several data sources, EXCEPT FOR ONE CAVEAT WE'LL TALK ABOUT NEXT
* Now that you know you are not limited to just events from your website, are there areas of your business that can be more effectively tracked with 
  1. using an integration we've written
  2. writing your own server-side tracking, connecting their API with our API?
