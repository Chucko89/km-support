[the concept of 'segmentation']

[Avinash Kaushik](http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/web-analytics-101-definitions-goals-metrics-kpis-dimensions-targets/#segment)

# Exercise

* Try segmenting your reports with properties that we have already collected for you, like `URL` or `Referrer`. We will also go into `Customer ID` in the next section.
* Consider other dimensions you will segment your customers by. As mentioned before, some common and effective segments are:
  * To group your visitors based on which version of an A/B test they are participating in. I NEED EXAMPLES OF IMPLEMENTING THIS
  * Which tagged referral sources (ads or non-ads) drive the "best" customers to your site. I NEED EXAMPLES OF IMPLEMENTING THIS

# Takeaways

* "Segmentation" refers to dividing up people based on different criteria. In KISSmetrics, this is most commonly done with Properties. (There are a couple of tools that allow using Events to segment people, but they will become apparent as you continue to use KISSmetrics.)
* Properties help you identify different customer segments in every report you run.
* You also capture numeric data like Revenue as Properties, which lets you do some numeric calculations like Sums and Averages.
* Sometimes it's rough making a distinction between whether to track an item as a specific event or as a generic event with properties.

* "Property" technically refers to what dimension you're segmenting on, the "Value" of the property refers to what segementation group this person belongs to.

Common ways we'll express properties:

"To set a property" or "a property was set"
"3 people had the Referrer property set to 'Google'""
"3 people had the value 'Google' set for the Referrer property"
