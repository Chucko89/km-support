We are developing a Revenue Report aimed specifically towards SaaS businesses. This is designed to be an improvement over our existing Revenue Report because it better visualizes the revenue gained from your subscribers month over month, also known as **Monthly Recurring Revenue**.

We've also accounted for businesses that don't bill exactly every single month. Even if you are billing your customers, say, annually, you can record that annual revenue amount just *once*, and we'll display each customer's month-by-month revenue by breaking that one annual revenue into 12 pieces.

This guide will use the following format:

**Example Recommended Event** <br />
When to trigger the event and any other contextual information

* Recommended property to set at the same time an event triggers
* Recommended property to set at the same time an event triggers
* Etc.

### Subscription Billed

Triggered when a customer is successfully billed for their payment.

## Section 2. How do I import previous transactions?

Please refer to our page on [Importing Data][import]. The properties are somewhat unique, so you'll most likely find yourself writing a little code to work with your backend servers or payment platform's API.

<a name="section-3"></a>
## Section 3. I have already been tracking revenue. How do update my old payments with the recommended structure?

Again, your best bet will be to [Import the Past Data][import]. Chances are you have a way to refer back to *who* was billed *when*...with that information, you can use the appropriate method of importing data to set the new properties you haven't been tracking, like "Subscription Billing Length".
