We have built an official Android SDK on top of work originally done in <https://github.com/80steve/KISSmetrics-4-Android>.

# Example Calls

{% highlight java %}
// Initialize the API
KISSmetricsAPI.sharedAPI(<API KEY>, <Application Context>);

// Track Event
KISSmetricsAPI.sharedAPI().record("Activated");
KISSmetricsAPI.sharedAPI().recordEvent("Activated");	// recordEvent() is being deprecated

// Track Event with Properties
HashMap<String, String> properties = new HashMap<String, String>();
properties.put("Item", "Potion");
properties.put("Amount", "10");
KISSmetricsAPI.sharedAPI().record("Purchase", properties);

// Set Properties
HashMap<String, String> properties = new HashMap<String, String>();
properties.put("Item", "Potion");
properties.put("Amount", "10");
KISSmetricsAPI.sharedAPI().set(properties);
KISSmetricsAPI.sharedAPI().setProperty(properties);	// setProperty() is being deprecated

/* New Functions as of v2 */
// Track an event only once per user
KISSmetricsAPI.sharedAPI().recordOnce("Installed App");

// Set user properties only if they have changed on the device
HashMap<String, String> properties = new HashMap<String, String>();
properties.put("OS version", "7.1");
KISSmetricsAPI.sharedAPI().setDistinct(properties);
{% endhighlight %}

# Optional Automated Tracking

## `autoRecordInstalls()`

Calling this records two events:

* Installed App
* Updated App

## `autoSetAppProperties()`

Calling this sets the following properties:

* App Version : 1.0.0 (aka: versionName)
* App Build : 1  (aka: versionCode)

## `autoSetHardwareProperties()`

Calling this sets the following properties:

* Device Manufacturer : asus
* Device Model: Nexus 7  (but this may also just be a cryptic model #. This depends on the manufacturer.)
* System Name : Android (hard-coded)
* System Version : 4.2.2

# Changes from v1

* The `identify` method now works the same as it does in our JavaScript library. That is, recording identities no longer aliases known identities to one another.
  * For example, if a user has been given a known identity such as "user@example.com" and a second call is made to identify: "another@example.com", the SDK no longer assumes that this a second known identity for the same user and these identities will no longer be aliased to one another automatically.
* Now, if there are 2 or more known identities of a user, a call to `alias` these two identities must be made.
* Previously, a call to `clearIdentity()` was required before a new users's identity was set. Though, it's still a good idea to call `clearIdentity()` when a user signs out.

## Android v2 SDK specs

* Size (compiled): 36KB
* Android version support: 2.2 (Froyo) (>99% of Android devices)
