# Exercise
<div class="alert alert-success alert-block">
Try segmenting your reports with properties that we have already collected for you, like `URL` or `Referrer`. We will also go into `Customer ID` in the next section.
</div>

# Takeaways

1. "[Segmentation][segmentation]" refers to dividing similar people into different buckets, so that you can more easily compare groups of people and take action. In KISSmetrics, this is most commonly done with *Properties*.
2. Properties help you identify different customer segments in every report you run.
3. You also capture numeric data like Revenue as Properties, which lets you do numeric calculations like Sums and Averages.
4. "Property" technically refers to what dimension you're segmenting on, the "Value" of the property refers to what segementation group this person belongs to.
5. Properties describe segments of *people*. They are stored **for each person** even though you can set properties at the same time you record events.

Common ways we'll talk about properties:

* "Set a property" or "a property was set"
* "3 people had the Referrer property set to 'Google'""
* "3 people had the value 'Google' set for the Referrer property"
